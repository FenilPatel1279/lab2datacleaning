# E-commerce Transactions Data Engineering Project 

In this project, a realistic e-commerce dataset with 500 transactions is subjected to the 12-move data engineering gas pipelines. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the data will be cleaned, enhanced, and analyzed. For additional insight, additional custom metadata and a data dictionary will be created. Workflows for changing information and wrangling in the real world are simulated in this activity.
